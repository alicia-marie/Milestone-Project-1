# Milestone-Project-1
My inspriaion for recreating checkers was to develop a game I'm familiar with, so I could go in with a basic understanding of how to format the game. While also ensuring plenty of resources to help guide my code throughout development. 

Checkers is a board game for two players. Each player has twelve pieces, colored black or red, each player's pieces on opposite sides. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally, either one space forward or by capturing an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally. The goal is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. When a piece reaches the opponent's last row, it is crowned and becomes a "king" that can move and capture in any direction. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces.

This code was written using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
